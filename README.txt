nIceBreaker

About:
This is a game for the TI-nSpire!  It is similar to the Windows game Jezzball and based off of IceBreaker game.  It works on the TI-NSpire CX CAS with ndless 3.1 and should work on all of the TI-nspire models.  The goal is to cover 75 percent of the game area so you advance to the next level.  I hope you enjoy it!

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-drop the nIceBreaker-sdl.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 on your calculator in order to run it!

How to play:
Press Enter to stop the intro and play the game.
Use either the 'f' key or the Shift key to flip the selector.
Press Ctrl or Enter to make a line.
Use the touchpad (or 2,4,6, and 8 keys) to move the selector around.
Use the 'p' key to pause/unpause.

Source:
I included the source.  The game is derived off the open source project Icebreaker.  It uses nSDL as well as the ndless Software Development Kit.
