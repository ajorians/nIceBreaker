July 30, 2001: released v1.2.1
  - fixed minor bug where highest-score line cut off letters that dip below
    the baseline (gjpqy...). Thanks to Jonathan DePrizio for catching this.
  - tiny little bugfixes, makefile cleanup
  - switched to much more sensible linux-kernel-style numbering scheme.
    (n.oddnumber.n for development releases, and n.evenumber.n for
    stable "production" releases -- for example, 1.2.1 is a stable release,
    so any excitement/surprises should come from the game, not from
    bugs. 1.9.0 will be a devel release, and some features may not work
    completely, or at all.)

July 28, 2001: released v1.2
  - added "score decay" timer, to discourage obsessive-compulsive types from
    taking hours on one level. Sure, I want you to be obsessed with the
    game, but have fun playing, not tediously waiting. :)
  - added easy and hard difficulty settings
  - added options for sound
  - added option for auto pause (which makes the game stop when the window
    loses focus -- note that it always pauses when minimized regardless of
    this setting).
  - now, when a line is stuck (against another line) for a long time,
    the line completes instead of exploding. ("A long time" == approximately
    5 seconds)
  - merged in Enrico Tassi's win32 compatibility stuff -- win32 version
    is now completely functional, except:
  - added fullscreen option! (Unfortunately, still has problems in Win32,
    so you'll have to edit the icebreaker.cfg manually if you want to enable
    this feature on a MS Windows system. I'll get the problem figured out
    for a future release.)
  - fixed busy waits in dialog.c (thanks again to Enrico)
  - code cleanup

July 23, 2001: released v1.1
  - added man page
  - tiny change to error message when high score file can't be read

July 18, 2001: released v1.09
  - Gameplay change: changed behavior when a line hits another
    partially-completed line -- now, instead of the line completing
    successfully, it waits until the other completes or is destroyed.  In
    the event that neither of those happens after a little while, new line
    dies. (I've considered making it complete successfully in this case;
    opinions, anyone?) This change makes the game much harder, in a good way.
  - moved center of vertical cursor to proper location (oops)
  - modified high score code to reread from disk, so that multiple players
    on the same system don't cause confusion. A race condition still exists,
    but it's much narrower. :) A future version will have proper locking.
  - include fix for cmpscore bug thanks to Enrico Tassi

October 5, 2000: released v1.0
  - one-point-oh!

October 3, 2000: released v0.995
  - minor cosmetic fixes
  - made 'make install' work; made it easier to redefine file locations
  - made it so three-decimal-place version numbers work :)
  - made level 100 loop forever instead of just ending the game there. 
    not that level 100 is any fun, really -- too many penguins!

October 2, 2000: released v0.98
  - first public release
