.TH icebreaker 6 "v$VERSION: $VERDATE"
.SH NAME
icebreaker - An addictive action-puzzle game for X.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B icebreaker
.SH DESCRIPTION
So, uh, there's a bunch of penguins on an iceberg in Antarctica. You
have been selected to catch them so they can be shipped to Finland, where
they are essential to a secret plot for world domination.
.PP
In order to trap the penguins, you'll need to break the iceberg into small
chunks by melting lines without hitting any of the birds. Once 80% or more
of the 'berg is gone, you advance to the next level.
.PP
Use the left mouse button to start lines, and the right (and/or middle)
button to toggle between horizontal and vertical. Beyond that, it's probably
easier for you go figure out the game by playing than by reading. So go.
.PP
Go!
.SH OPTIONS
None in current version; in the future there will probably be some. See
