Some of this is work in progress, and some it is just stuff I'd like to see.
Check out <http://www.mattdm.org/icebreaker/development.shtml> for details.

* innumerable sections of the code are marked with "FIX", in places where I
  know I did something messy, foolish, or inefficient.
* there are likely other bits of messiness, foolishness, and inefficiency
  which I haven't realized are there
* this is part of the above, but bears mentioning separately: some of the
  code is the product of late-night hacking and, while it works fine,
  desperately needs cleaning up

* clean up fullscreen mode in win32
* need titlebar-equivalent in fullscreen mode, so one can see the current
  level.
* the sounds are totally borrowed from other people. need original ones.
* add command line options
* add keyboard support
* option to turn off scrolling level-end text
* make GNOME/KDE versions?
* the animation is really jerky with some refresh rates. what to do about
  this? last time I wrote a game was under DOS, and you could easily
  sync to the vertical refresh.....
* check for high scores on 'quit'
* fix race condition in readhiscore()/checkhiscore()/addhiscore() -- 
  add lock file
* there is a little bug where in certain situations you can start an
  opposing line directly in the path of an oncoming line, causing lines 
  which are essentially on top of each other. Not a terribly fatal flaw,
  but I'm going to fix it sometime. :)
* skins -- FreeBSD, etc.
